# ES6 to ES3 #

This is an experimental project to the test various aspects of related to building a toolchain to convert standard ES6+ code to JScript (ES3). The output specifically targets JScript rather than legacy browsers as it's designed for the non-browser environment that uses the CScript interpreter that still ships with Windows 10.
